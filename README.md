## Case study solving approach
* Data Understanding
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis
* Final Recommendations

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## Data Understanding
- Check the shape, size and data type of profided Loan dataset
- Check head and tail of data set for any discrepancy
- Check null values in columns
- Understansd Column description with help of Data Dictionary

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Data Cleaning
- Remove columns with high null and duplicale values
- Remove columns not required for analysis
- Remove rows with missing values
- Convert datatype to numeric, wherever possible, for easy analysis

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Data Analysis
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Plots and results from analysis

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Recommendations
- Final recommendations based on analysis

## Technologies Used
- Pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib.pyplot library
- seaborn library
